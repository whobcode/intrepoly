the game board is still blocked a bit at the top and a little at the bottom i 
need the game board seen entirely, i want cpu to be ai agents that actually play
 when a spot isnt taken by a human. rplace the word local with hoomun 
throughout UI and cpu into ai, create ai agents using the ollama api and/or the 
cloudflare ai, take away the local and cpu dropdown from the start and unless 
their are 8 players in the game always have an ai agent in the game playing.
